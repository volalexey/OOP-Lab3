# Lab 3: Constructors and Method Overloading

## Description
This update enhances the flexibility of the `Planet` class by implementing multiple initialization strategies and method variations using polymorphism (overloading).

## Objectives
* Implement class constructors for proper object initialization.
* Apply constructor overloading.
* Apply method overloading.

## Implementation
The class structure was updated to support different instantiation scenarios.

### Key Features
* **Constructor Overloading:** Implemented three distinct constructors:
    1.  **Default Constructor:** Initializes an object with default values.
    2.  **Full Constructor:** Accepts parameters for all properties.
    3.  **Partial Constructor:** Accepts a specific subset of parameters (e.g., type only) for quick initialization.
* **Method Overloading:** Public methods now have overloaded versions to handle different argument types or counts.
